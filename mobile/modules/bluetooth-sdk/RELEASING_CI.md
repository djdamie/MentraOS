# Bluetooth SDK Release CI

The Bluetooth SDK release workflow lives at
`.github/workflows/bluetooth-sdk-release.yml`. It runs on pushes to `staging`
that touch the SDK package, the release workflow, or the SwiftPM export script.
A release is only attempted when the `version` field in
`mobile/modules/bluetooth-sdk/package.json` changes compared with the previous
`staging` commit.

The same version drives all public artifacts:

- ASG OTA manifest:
  `https://staging.ota.mentraglass.com/bluetooth-sdk/VERSION/version.json`
- ASG APK release asset under the persistent `bluetooth-sdk-ota` release tag
- npm staged package: `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk`
- Maven Central: `com.mentraglass:bluetooth-sdk` and `com.mentraglass:lc3Lib`
- SwiftPM: tag `VERSION` in `Mentra-Community/mentra-bluetooth-sdk-ios`

The rolling staging OTA manifest (`staging_live_version.json`), the
`staging-builds` release, and the 7-day cleanup for dated rolling staging APKs
remain separate. SDK OTA APKs are never uploaded into the rolling cleanup bucket.

## Required Registry Settings, GitHub Secrets, and Variables

Configure npm Trusted Publishing for `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk` before relying on
the workflow for a real npm stage release:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Provider | GitHub Actions |
| Organization or user | `Mentra-Community` |
| Repository | `MentraOS` |
| Workflow filename | `bluetooth-sdk-release.yml` |
| Environment name | Leave blank unless the workflow starts using a GitHub environment |
| Allowed actions | `npm stage publish` |

Trusted Publishing requires GitHub-hosted runners, Node 22.14 or newer, and npm
11.15 or newer for staged publishing. The workflow runs the npm job on
`ubuntu-latest`, sets up Node 24, and updates npm before staging.

After the Trusted Publisher is configured and verified, set the package's npm
Publishing access to require 2FA and disallow tokens.

Create these in the `Mentra-Community/MentraOS` repository before relying on the
workflow for a real release:

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_TOKEN_BASE64` | Secret | Base64 string of `username:password` for the Sonatype Central publishing token. |
| `MAVEN_SIGNING_KEY` | Secret | ASCII-armored PGP private key used by Gradle in-memory signing. |
| `MAVEN_SIGNING_PASSWORD` | Secret | Passphrase for `MAVEN_SIGNING_KEY`. |
| `MENTRA_BLUETOOTH_SDK_IOS_PUSH_TOKEN` | Secret | GitHub token with write access to `Mentra-Community/mentra-bluetooth-sdk-ios` for pushing `main` and version tags. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Secret | Cloudflare account that owns the `mentra-live-ota-staging` Pages project. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_API_TOKEN` | Secret | Cloudflare API token allowed to deploy the `mentra-live-ota-staging` Pages project. |
| `SONATYPE_PUBLISHING_TYPE` | Variable | Sonatype Central upload mode; keep `user_managed` unless maintainers intentionally switch to an automatic release mode. |

## Flow

1. The detector job reads `mobile/modules/bluetooth-sdk/package.json` at `HEAD`
   and at the prior push SHA. If the version did not change, the workflow exits
   after writing a summary. If GitHub does not provide a usable prior push SHA,
   the detector fails closed; rerun with `workflow_dispatch` and
   `force_release=true` after confirming the version should release.
2. The SDK OTA job builds the ASG client APK from the same `staging` commit,
   uploads it to the persistent `bluetooth-sdk-ota` GitHub release with an asset
   name that includes the SDK version, ASG `versionCode`, and commit SHA, then
   generates `bluetooth-sdk/VERSION/version.json` with ASG APK metadata plus the
   MTK and BES metadata from `asg_client/ota_manifests/firmware_live.json`.
   The ASG `versionCode` uses the same Jan 1 2025 wall-clock offset formula as
   rolling staging builds, but uses the release commit timestamp so reruns of the
   same SDK release commit produce the same ASG target.
3. The SDK OTA job refuses to overwrite an existing manifest URL or release
   asset for the same SDK version. It rebuilds the Cloudflare Pages payload from
   the persistent SDK manifest assets, preserves the rolling
   `staging_live_version.json`, deploys to the staging OTA Pages project, and
   verifies the custom-domain URL before package publishing starts.
4. The npm job installs mobile workspace dependencies, builds the SDK package,
   checks whether `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk@VERSION` already exists, runs
   `npm pack --dry-run`, then submits the package with `npm stage publish` when
   the workflow is not in dry-run mode. A maintainer must approve the staged
   package before it becomes available on npm.
5. The Maven job installs the mobile workspace, runs Expo prebuild to create the
   generated `mobile/android` Gradle project, checks Maven Central for both
   Android artifacts, runs a public-mode `publishToMavenLocal`, then uploads the
   signed public-mode `lc3Lib` and `mentra-bluetooth-sdk` publications to
   Sonatype Central.
6. The iOS job checks out the SwiftPM mirror repository, refuses to overwrite an
   existing version tag, exports the package with
   `scripts/export-bluetooth-sdk-ios-spm.sh --verify`, then pushes `main` and
   the version tag.

## Manual Steps That Remain

The npm package is staged, not published live. After the workflow stages a
version, a maintainer must open npmjs.com, review the staged package from the
Staged Packages tab, and approve it with 2FA. The CLI alternative is to run
`npm stage list @mentra/bluetooth-sdk`, inspect the stage ID with
`npm stage view <stage-id>`, and approve with `npm stage approve <stage-id>`.

Maven Central still uses `user_managed` publishing. After the workflow uploads
the deployment, a maintainer must open
`https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments`, inspect the deployment,
and manually publish it. The workflow intentionally does not auto-release the
Sonatype deployment until maintainers decide that is safe.

The SDK OTA manifest and APK are intentionally immutable. Publishing the same
SDK version twice fails before package artifacts are published; bump the SDK
version for a new ASG compatibility target. Existing live npm versions and
SwiftPM tags are skipped. A pending npm staged package for the same version will
cause `npm stage publish` to fail until the staged package is approved or
rejected. Maven reruns are safe only after confirming there is no open Sonatype
deployment for the same version; if Maven Central already shows both artifacts,
the workflow skips Maven publishing.

## Dry Runs and Verification

Use `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run=true` to exercise the build/export path
without publishing. This builds the ASG APK and generated manifest, performs npm
`pack --dry-run`, Maven `publishToMavenLocal`, and SwiftPM export verification
unless the exact version already exists in that registry, in which case the
matching artifact job skips rather than attempting a duplicate release. Set
`force_release=true` only when you intentionally want to run release jobs even
though the SDK package version did not change.

After a real release:

```bash
npm view @mentra/bluetooth-sdk@VERSION version
npm stage list @mentra/bluetooth-sdk
curl -fsS "https://staging.ota.mentraglass.com/bluetooth-sdk/VERSION/version.json"
curl -fsS "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/mentraglass/bluetooth-sdk/VERSION/bluetooth-sdk-VERSION.pom"
curl -fsS "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/mentraglass/lc3Lib/VERSION/lc3Lib-VERSION.pom"
git ls-remote --tags git@github.com:Mentra-Community/mentra-bluetooth-sdk-ios.git VERSION
```
